${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} How to use it?

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Unit Test
You can run the JUnit test [ProcessTest](src/test/java/${packageInPathFormat}/ProcessTest.java) in your IDE or using:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Deployment to an Application Server
You can also build and deploy the process application to an application server.
For an easy start you can download WildFly with a pre-installed Camunda
from our [Download Page](https://downloads.camunda.cloud/release/camunda-bpm/wildfly/).

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Manually
1. Build the application using:

```bash
mvn clean package
```
2. Copy the *.war file from the `target` directory to the deployment directory
of your application server e.g. `wildfly/standalone/deployments`.
For a faster 1-click (re-)deployment see the alternatives below.

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} WildFly (using WildFly Maven Plugin)
1. Build and deploy the process application using:

```bash

```


${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Run and Inspect with Tasklist and Cockpit
Once you deployed the application you can run it using
[Camunda Tasklist](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist)
and inspect it using
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).
