# Camunda Maven Archetypes

These are project templates for [Camunda Platform](http://camunda.org/), which enable a quickstart for developing process applications.

## Build from Source

A local build of all archetypes can be achieved with `mvn clean source:jar install` in the root directory. 
You can also build separate archetypes in their respective modules with the same command.

Besides, a couple of utility scripts that can aid in development can be found in the `utilities` directory.
